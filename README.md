# NFT-Based Membership & Loyalty Program

## Project Description

This platform enables businesses to issue NFTs as dynamic membership cards or loyalty tokens. These NFTs unlock exclusive benefits, accumulate rewards automatically, and can be traded on secondary markets, providing real utility beyond speculation. The system is ideal for gyms, clubs, restaurants, retail stores, or creator communities seeking to build engaged, loyal customer bases through blockchain technology.

## Project Vision

- **Create Interoperability**: Enable cross-business loyalty ecosystems where members can leverage their reputation across multiple establishments
